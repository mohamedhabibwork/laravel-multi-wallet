## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **PHP 8.1+** (latest stable recommended)
- **Composer 2.0+**
- **Laravel 10.0+**
- **Git**
- **Database** (MySQL 8.0+, PostgreSQL 12+, SQLite 3.35+)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohamedhabibwork/laravel-multi-wallet.git
   cd laravel-multi-wallet
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set up testing environment**
   ```bash
   cp phpunit.xml.dist phpunit.xml
   ```

4. **Run tests to ensure everything works**
   ```bash
   composer test
   ```

5. **Set up pre-commit hooks (optional)**
   ```bash
   # Install pre-commit hooks for code quality
   composer run-script post-install-cmd
   ```

### IDE Setup

#### PHPStorm/IntelliJ IDEA
- Install **PHP Annotations** plugin
- Configure **PHPStan** integration
- Set up **Laravel Pint** as external tool

#### VS Code
- Install **PHP Intelephense** extension
- Install **Laravel Pint** extension
- Configure **PHPStan** integration

### Database Setup

The package uses SQLite for testing by default. For local development:

```bash
# Create test database
touch database/database.sqlite

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate --env=testing
```

## üß™ Testing

We maintain comprehensive test coverage. All contributions must include appropriate tests.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage
composer test-coverage

# Run specific test file
vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature/WalletTest.php

# Run tests with specific filter
vendor/bin/pest --filter="can create wallet"

# Run tests in parallel (faster)
vendor/bin/pest --parallel

# Run tests with verbose output
vendor/bin/pest --verbose
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests** (`tests/Unit/`) - Test individual methods and classes
- **Feature Tests** (`tests/Feature/`) - Test complete workflows
- **Integration Tests** - Test database operations and external services
- **Architecture Tests** (`tests/ArchTest.php`) - Test code structure

### Writing Tests

#### Test Naming Convention
```php
// Good test names
test('it can create wallet with valid parameters')
test('it throws exception when debiting insufficient funds')
test('it can transfer funds between wallets with fee')

// Avoid generic names
test('test wallet creation') // Too generic
test('works') // Not descriptive
```

#### Test Structure (AAA Pattern)
```php
test('it can transfer funds between wallets with fee', function () {
    // Arrange - Set up test data
    $sender = User::factory()->create();
    $recipient = User::factory()->create();
    $senderWallet = $sender->createWallet('USD', 'Main');
    $recipientWallet = $recipient->createWallet('USD', 'Main');
    $senderWallet->credit(100.00, 'available');
    
    // Act - Perform the action being tested
    $transfer = $sender->transferTo($recipient, 50.00, 'USD', ['fee' => 2.50]);
    
    // Assert - Verify the results
    expect($transfer->getNetAmount())->toBe(52.50);
    expect($senderWallet->fresh()->getBalance('available'))->toBe(47.50);
    expect($recipientWallet->fresh()->getBalance('available'))->toBe(50.00);
});
```

#### Test Best Practices

- **Use factories** for test data generation
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
- **Keep tests independent** - no shared state
- **Use descriptive assertions** - explain what you're testing
- **Mock external dependencies** when appropriate
- **Test both positive and negative scenarios**

### Test Data

```php
// Use factories for consistent test data
$user = User::factory()->create();
$wallet = Wallet::factory()->for($user)->create();

// Create specific test scenarios
$wallet = Wallet::factory()
    ->for($user)
    ->state(['currency' => 'USD', 'balance' => 1000.00])
    ->create();
```

## üìù Code Style

We use **Laravel Pint** for code formatting and **PHPStan** for static analysis.

### Code Standards

- **PSR-12** coding standards
- **Type declarations** for all parameters and return types
- **PHPDoc blocks** for all public methods
- **Meaningful variable names** - avoid abbreviations
- **Small, focused methods** - single responsibility
- **SOLID principles** - clean architecture

### Running Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Fix code style issues automatically
composer format

# Check code style without fixing
vendor/bin/pint --test

# Run static analysis
composer analyse

# Run all quality checks
composer check-quality
```

### Code Style Examples

#### Good Code Style
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace HWallet\LaravelMultiWallet\Services;

use HWallet\LaravelMultiWallet\Models\Wallet;
use HWallet\LaravelMultiWallet\Models\Transfer;

class WalletService
{
    /**
     * Transfer funds between wallets.
     *
     * @param Wallet $fromWallet The source wallet
     * @param Wallet $toWallet The destination wallet
     * @param float $amount The amount to transfer
     * @param array<string, mixed> $options Additional transfer options
     *
     * @throws InsufficientFundsException When source wallet has insufficient funds
     * @throws InvalidAmountException When amount is invalid
     */
    public function transfer(
        Wallet $fromWallet,
        Wallet $toWallet,
        float $amount,
        array $options = []
    ): Transfer {
        $this->validateTransfer($fromWallet, $toWallet, $amount);
        
        return $this->executeTransfer($fromWallet, $toWallet, $amount, $options);
    }
}
```

```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility** - Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed** - Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution** - Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation** - Many specific interfaces are better than one general
- **Dependency Inversion** - Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Patterns Used

- **Repository Pattern** - For data access abstraction
- **Service Pattern** - For business logic encapsulation
- **Factory Pattern** - For object creation
- **Observer Pattern** - For event handling
- **Strategy Pattern** - For configurable behaviors
- **Builder Pattern** - For complex object construction
